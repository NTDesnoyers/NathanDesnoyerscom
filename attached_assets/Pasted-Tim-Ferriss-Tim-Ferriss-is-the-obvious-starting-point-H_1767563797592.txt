Tim Ferriss
Tim Ferriss is the obvious starting point.
He has been one of the most consistently influential people in my life—not because I agree with everything he says, but because of how he thinks and how he learns. His curiosity, willingness to experiment, and the way he asks questions have shaped how I approach conversations, decisions, and learning across my life.
When you distill Ninja Selling—the system I use to run my real estate business—down to its most basic form, it comes down to this: ask good questions, listen for change, and serve as that change. At its core, it’s about attention—about noticing what matters to people and responding accordingly.
That’s why Tim resonates so deeply with me. His interviews feel less like interrogations and more like extended listening sessions. He stays genuinely curious, lets ideas unfold in real time, and isn’t afraid to sit with uncertainty. That approach has influenced how I show up not just in business, but in relationships and day-to-day life.
I first got into personal development around 2018, right after graduating college. I was trying to mature—to be better at life, to figure out how to function as an adult. I had heard about The 4-Hour Workweek for years, but I don’t think I actually read it until 2020 or 2021.
What I remember most clearly isn’t the book itself, but what it gave me permission to question.
I tried to apply some of those ideas at my job. I asked whether remote work was possible. The answer was a firm no. At the time, I more or less said that I would be working a fully remote job eventually anyway.
When I was fired in June 2022, that conversation came back up—as evidence that I had already mentally moved on.
So—thank you, Tim, for helping me name that truth early.
I don’t blame them. From their perspective, why would they have let me do that?
Around that same period, I got my real estate license. In the early years, real-estate-specific podcasts dominated my listening. Over time, that shifted—not because the material stopped being useful, but because I had absorbed most of what I could. The learning moved from consumption to application.
My original plan was straightforward: succeed at my job, build real estate on the side, and quit once the income pipeline was clear. That would have been a good plan if I had followed it.
But I’ve learned that sometimes the right move isn’t waiting for the perfect transition—it’s recognizing when something simply isn’t aligned anymore.
There is something admirable about people who can push through discomfort. My best friend Luke is a great example—he succeeded in a job he didn’t enjoy and then started his business. That’s a quality I respect and aspire to.
I do that in my own way—just not endlessly. I’m selective about the discomforts I choose to endure: hard conversations, administrative work, taxes, operational friction. Those are the tracks I’ll replay. Others I’ve learned to skip.
In that sense, Tim’s influence isn’t a single lesson or book—it’s the through-line. A recurring motif that keeps pulling me back to the same questions: What am I paying attention to? What assumptions am I carrying forward out of habit? Where am I being honest with myself—and where am I not? More than tactics or tools, that pattern of attention has shaped how I make decisions, even when the transition between chapters isn’t clean.
