Northern Virginia 40 Under 40 Nomination

I was recently nominated for the Northern Virginia 40 Under 40 awards, which recognizes young professionals making an impact in our region. As part of the application process, I was asked to reflect on my leadership, civic engagement, and personal journey. Below are my responses to the three questions posed by the selection committee.


Please describe the leadership impact you have had in the community through your professional and personal achievements.

My leadership philosophy is simple: show up, listen deeply, and create value beyond the transaction. Whether in real estate, Rotary, BNI, or the Chamber of Commerce, I've built my practice around being a trusted connector and creating sustainable systems that amplify impact.

In real estate, I've embraced a relationship-based approach inspired by Ninja Selling's training. I'm not just helping people buy and sell homes; I'm a connector, educator, and resource in their lives. My clients come to me for referrals to estate planners, investment advice, community connections, and personal support during major life transitions. I collaborate with other business owners to host estate planning seminars and real estate investing workshops because I believe an informed client is an empowered client. I've closed over $10 million in volume while maintaining a referral-based business, but the metric I'm most proud of is how often someone reaches out not about real estate, but because they remembered I "knew someone" who could help with their specific challenge.

My commitment to community leadership is equally intentional. Since joining Rotary in fall 2022, I've rapidly advanced from Public Image Chair to Vice President to my current role as President. As VP, I coordinated weekly speakers, turning every networking opportunity into a chance to discover compelling stories. As President, I'm implementing transformational changes: shifting from exhausting one-time fundraising events to a year-round corporate sponsorship model that's already matched last year's $25,000 golf tournament revenue with minimal overhead. I'm overhauling our meeting experience with hybrid options, video marketing, and agentic AI to automate administrative tasks. I'm rewriting our bylaws to streamline leadership paths because sustainable impact requires succession planning. These partnerships directly support our literacy and food scarcity initiatives, including distributing dictionaries to every third grader and Constitution booklets to every eighth grader in Fairfax.

In BNI, I helped launch a new chapter in January 2024 and later merged it with a struggling chapter to create something stronger. I consistently lead in referrals given, qualified visitor recruitment, and closed business celebrations. I've directly recruited five members and mentor several others. I serve on the membership committee, where my focus is helping members understand that networking is about creating value, not just collecting leads.

As a Central Fairfax Chamber of Commerce Ambassador, I act as an official community representative, promoting chamber events and connecting businesses across the region. This role has given me frequent access to Mayor Catherine Read and other community leaders like Hakan Atasever, Executive Director of the American Turkish Friendship Association. Through these connections, I'm facilitating joint events between Rotary and community organizations, creating partnerships that extend beyond any single group's reach.
