Epistemology, Meaning, and Spirituality
Some of the most influential listening I did this year doesn’t fit neatly into business or technology.
David Deutsch has been especially impactful. I’ve read The Beginning of Infinity and listened multiple times to his conversations with Tim Ferriss and Naval Ravikant. What resonates most isn’t just the science, but the philosophy—epistemology, what makes a good explanation, and how knowledge actually progresses. Understanding how we know things, and what makes an explanation good or bad, has shaped my decision-making more deeply than simply absorbing information ever could.
Naval Ravikant appears here less as a content source and more as a philosophical reference point. When Tim speaks highly of someone, I pay attention. Naval’s clarity around leverage, truth-seeking, and attention has quietly influenced how I think about work, learning, and life—even when I’m not actively listening to him.
I also loved The Random Show with Tim Ferriss and Kevin Rose. Their conversations remind me of long, meandering discussions with close friends—sharing ideas, habits, philosophies, and life updates without an agenda. Listening to them often makes me want to pick up the phone and reconnect with people I care about.
Despite how much of my attention goes toward technology, I’m also a daily meditator. I meditate using The Way app with Henry Shukman, and I’ll expand more on this when I write about his book One Blade of Grass. Exploring spirituality and consciousness intellectually is interesting, but experiencing it directly through daily practice has been grounding in a way that thinking alone isn’t.
I also spent time with The Bible in a Year podcast. I’m a confirmed Roman Catholic and was raised in the Church. I don’t currently attend regularly and have drifted from some of its explicit teachings, but I feel called to revisit the life of Jesus through an adult lens. I’m starting a book on his life now, and I want to engage with that tradition more thoughtfully moving forward.
