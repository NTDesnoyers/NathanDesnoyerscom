Build a minimal, fast, static personal website for a builder documenting his long-term work and thinking.

Context:
- This site is the canonical home for long-form writing and dated journal entries.
- The owner is a builder working primarily in real estate, technology, AI, and systems.
- The goal is to document thinking over time and create a durable public record (“public lab notebook”), not a marketing funnel.
- Writing velocity, clarity, and long-term archive quality matter more than conversion optimization.
- Distribution (Substack, social, email) happens elsewhere; this site is the durable library.

Identity & Tone:
- Builder-first, career-focused
- Calm, thoughtful, professional, non-promotional
- Serious but human
- Not a lifestyle blog and not a Realtor® landing page
- Feels like a research notebook / thinking archive

Technical Requirements:
- Static site (no database)
- Content authored in Markdown files
- Easy to add new content by creating new Markdown files
- Clean, readable typography
- Very fast load times
- Minimal JavaScript
- Stable, human-readable URLs
- RSS feed support
- Designed to be portable and durable over decades

Top-Level Site Structure:
- Home
- Notes
- Essays
- Real Estate
- About

Content Model:

1. Notes (primary writing surface)
   - Raw, exploratory, in-progress thinking
   - One entry per Markdown file
   - Each entry must begin with a date header in this exact format:
     YYYY.MM.DD
   - Date must appear on its own line at the top of the file
   - Entries are listed in reverse chronological order
   - Each entry has its own permanent URL
   - No comments or engagement features

2. Essays
   - More structured, compressed writing
   - Still plainspoken and non-marketing
   - One essay per Markdown file
   - Stable permalinks
   - Listed chronologically

3. Real Estate (/real-estate)
   - A single professional section, not a conversion-focused microsite
   - Purpose: reassure and route warm, referred, or trust-based visitors
   - Content should include:
     - Clear statement that the owner is a licensed Realtor® in Northern Virginia
     - Who he works with best
     - How he approaches buying and selling
     - Links to external profiles for reviews (Google, Zillow, LinkedIn, etc.)
     - Clear contact path
   - No IDX, no listing search, no SEO keyword stuffing
   - Calm, compliant, and professional
   - Designed to interlock with Google Business Profile (GBP should link here)

4. About
   - Brief explanation of the project and intent:
     “I’m a builder documenting my work and thinking over time.”
   - Mention domains of focus: real estate, technology, AI, systems
   - No resume-style content
   - No hype language

Navigation:
- Simple top navigation: Home, Notes, Essays, Real Estate, About
- Default landing experience should emphasize writing (Notes / Essays), not services

URLs:
- Notes: /notes/YYYY.MM.DD-optional-slug
- Essays: /essays/YYYY-MM-optional-slug
- Real Estate: /real-estate
- URLs must not change once published

Design Constraints:
- Clean, minimal, professional
- Optimized for reading
- No popups, no lead magnets, no aggressive calls to action
- No comments, likes, or social widgets
- Neutral color palette
- Typography-first design

Future-Proofing:
- Structure should support:
  - RSS feeds
  - Easy syndication to Substack or email
  - Full archive export later
- Avoid platform-specific dependencies
- Avoid overengineering

Deliverables:
- Project file structure
- Sample Markdown file for a Note (with YYYY.MM.DD date header)
- Sample Markdown file for an Essay
- Basic styling focused on readability
- Clear inline comments explaining how to add new Notes and Essays
