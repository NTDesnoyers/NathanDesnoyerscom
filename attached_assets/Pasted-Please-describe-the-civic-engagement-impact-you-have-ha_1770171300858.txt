Please describe the civic engagement impact you have had in the community.

My civic engagement is rooted in a simple belief: everyone has something to offer, and my role is connecting people to opportunities where they can make the biggest difference. Through Rotary, BNI, and the Chamber of Commerce, I've built a network that turns individual goodwill into collective impact.

As Rotary Club President, I oversee initiatives that directly touch hundreds of lives each year. Our annual Christmas party, in partnership with the Salvation Army, serves roughly 30 families in need. Children write letters to Santa, and we buy and wrap every gift. Sponsored by Chick-fil-A, Nothing Bundt Cakes, American Legion, and Ace Hardware, the event features hot dogs, carols, and the joy of watching each child sit on Santa's lap to receive their presents. The Girl Scouts run a book drive, bringing hundreds of books for children to choose from under a Christmas tree. It's a reminder that civic engagement isn't just about writing checks, it's about showing up and creating moments of dignity and joy for families facing hard times.

We also distribute dictionaries to every third grader in Fairfax and Constitution booklets to every eighth grader. The Constitution project is particularly meaningful. Eighth graders gather in an auditorium with a panel of Rotary leaders, the mayor, and local delegates to discuss constitutional literacy. Students don't just receive booklets, they engage in real dialogue about what they'd change, why it matters, and how civic participation shapes their futures. It's not a lecture, it's a conversation that treats young people as the engaged citizens they're capable of becoming.

Beyond these flagship initiatives, we run essay, speech, and music contests where winners advance through the district. We award over $20,000 in scholarships annually. We participate in Read Across America, going directly into classrooms for story time. These aren't one-off events, they're sustained investments in the next generation.

As a Central Fairfax Chamber of Commerce Ambassador, I amplify these efforts by connecting businesses, nonprofits, and government leaders. My work with Mayor Catherine Read and Hakan Atasever of the American Turkish Friendship Association has led to joint events like our upcoming Ramadan dinner. The ATFA routinely hosts interfaith and community events, bringing together people who would otherwise remain siloed by culture and community. In the most ethnically diverse part of the United States, there's no better way to build understanding than by breaking bread together. These partnerships aren't just feel-good gestures, they're essential bridge-building in a region where diversity is our greatest strength.

My most valuable contribution isn't any single project, it's the multiplier effect of being a connector. I know contractors, financial advisors, investors, volunteers, and skilled professionals across every sector. When someone needs help, whether it's an introduction to a contractor, advice on finances, opportunities to invest or donate, or ways to volunteer their time and skills, I make it happen. My civic engagement isn't just what I do personally, it's what I enable others to do by putting them in the right room with the right people at the right time.
