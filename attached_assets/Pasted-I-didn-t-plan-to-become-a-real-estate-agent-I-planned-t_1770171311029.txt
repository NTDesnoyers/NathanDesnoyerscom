I didn't plan to become a real estate agent. I planned to be an engineer. I went to school for mechanical engineering because I was good at math and people told me I'd make good money. I wasn't passionate about it, I just checked the box. I did internships that I hated but pushed through anyway. C's get degrees, right? After graduation, I pivoted into technical sales. I loved the sales part, helping clients, solving problems, but I hated the product: high-voltage test equipment. I needed to find something I could be genuinely excited about.

That something was real estate, but not in the way you'd expect. My best friend bought a house hack and couldn't stop talking about it. I became obsessed, self-taught everything I could, and bought my first property. My realtor seemed to be living an incredible life: successful, financially free, traveling. I realized that if I wanted to invest at the level I dreamed of, I needed to unlock my highest dollar-per-hour activity. Real estate wasn't just a career opportunity, it was the platform for everything I wanted to build. This was my "adjacent possibilities" moment. I followed curiosity, and it led somewhere I never anticipated.

The transition wasn't easy. Going from salary to commission was a shock. I couldn't hide behind a paycheck; if I didn't provide value, I didn't get paid. For over a year, I worked full-time and hosted two to three open houses every weekend. I kept grinding because it laid the bedrock for my business. I built my database from scratch, person by person, through open houses and networking.

When I discovered Ninja Selling, everything clicked. Larry Kendall's story about joining Rotary and the Chamber, embedding himself in his community, resonated deeply. I realized real estate wasn't just about transactions; it was about becoming a resource, connector, and leader. So I followed his example. I joined Rotary, BNI, and the Chamber, committed to being the professional who shows up, listens, and serves.

What drives me is the desire to be in flow, a search for meaning and impact. I'm motivated by helping people. Money is a metric to track value, not motivation. I want financial freedom as an unlock to leverage myself more to help people. My wife Cintia is my soulmate and emotional support, my sounding board and graphic designer for all my marketing. We bought a house in fall 2025 where we can start a family and host dinner parties. These events are filled with clients, not to get business, but because I do business with friends, and my clients become my friends.

I walk the line between being eternally grateful and striving for more. I'm philosophical, consuming podcasts and audiobooks, meditating and exercising daily. I didn't start as an engineer to end up here, but I'm grateful for the winding path. It taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of following what genuinely excites you. That's my story: curiosity, community, and the belief that when you serve others well, success follows.
